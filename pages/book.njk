                                Want to know what it's like to prowl the wilds of Taiwan to photograph snakes and other wild critters? 
                                This book tells it all! In <em>A Cobra Hijacked My Camera Bag!</em>, Hans Breuer searches for a new pet ratsnake in Taipei restaurants, 
                                loses a coral snake in his living room, confronts a cobra in complete darkness, and assumes unorthodox yogic postures to photograph kraits, 
                                habus, and bamboo vipers. Between the tree ferns of Taiwan's lush, rugged mountains, Hans draws us along to experience a fantastic variety 
                                of snakes, along with turtles, civets, pangolins, and other representatives of the island's immense biodiversity. During his constant search 
                                for reptiles and amphibians, Hans introduces the best of Taiwan with quirky humor, while educating the reader in remarkable detail. 
                                Twenty-two years on the island, and fluency in Mandarin Chinese, has given Hans a broad experience with all facets of Taiwan life, 
                                complementing his herpetological observations. We learn about family relations, food and drinking customs, dealing with curious police 
                                officers, and the aboriginal relationship to Taiwan's rich animal life. With this book in hand, you don't need a plane ticket to enjoy the 
                                thrill of herping Taiwan, but after reading Hans' adventures, you might just book your next vacation there!
