Head is elongate oval to slightly triangular and distinct from neck; body is slender; tail is long. Eye is large; iris is medium to dark brown, dappled and flecked with light brown and pupil is broadly elliptical on vertical axis. There is a prominent angular ridge from upper eye to end of snout. Tongue is dark brown to black; teeth are long, well developed, resembling fangs in upper jaw. There are three pairs of chin plates. Upper head is light to dark brown or even chocolate with a darker, longitudinal ''Y'' whose arms extend forward onto the ridge between eye and snout, basing at the posterior margin of the parietals, and extending posteriorly along the mid-dorsal line. The supralabials are lighter in color, mottled with white, dirt yellow or black. Upper body and tail are light to dark brown or even chocolate, tinged with scattered, diffuse, deep red and/or scattered deposits of diffuse dark brown to black which is more prominent anteriorly. Ventral head is white to light gray, mottled with tan, black or gray; the deposits of black on the infralabials may form a longitudinal line. Ventral body is light gray to dark gray brown, mottled with brown or gray pigment which concentrates to form light longitudinal lines. Anal scale is entire, and subcaudals are paired.

                        The triangular head that is clearly distinct from the neck is very characteristic for this cathemeral 
                        (diurnal and nocturnal), <i>opistoglyphous</i> (= rear-fanged, see footnote (<i>1</i>)) species. The shape of the head is 
                        the reason this snake is often confused with pitvipers, and also the reason for its common English name. 
                        Many members of the family Colubridae that are considered venomous are essentially harmless to humans, 
                        because they either have small venom glands, relatively weak venom, or an inefficient system for venom delivery. 
                        The Mock viper's venom is actually much less powerful and less harmful to humans than that of true vipers. The 
                        teeth are adapted to feeding on heavy-scaled  vertebrates, like skinks, and other snakes, but <i>P. p. papenfussi</i> 
                        also eats frogs.

                        hardly any head or body patterns, while others specimens show small spots or stripes.

                        The dentures of this species are "unusual, because it has grooved rear fangs and front 
                        fangs with shallow grooves. This is the only snake known to have fangs in both positions 
                        on the maxillary. Harry Greene suggested the front fangs are used to snare hard-scaled, 
                        slippery skinks (a group of lizards with a bony plate under each very smooth scale). 
                        When Kate Jackson and Thomas Fritts looked at the fangs, however, they found grooves 
                        in the front fangs. These grooves were not the deep folds with rounded edges that run 
                        the length of the fang as in some rear fanged species. These teeth contained multiple 
                        shallow grooves that could allow liquids from the mouth to enter a wound, increase the 
                        ability of the fang to penetrate the prey, or facilitate pulling 
                        the teeth out of the prey." (John C.

                    As with most other rear-fanged species, not much is known about the Mock Viper's venom. 
                    There are no reports of deaths or severe bites, but there may be swelling, redness and aching 
                    muscles in the bite area. The venom might contain some kind of anti-coagulant in the venom, 
                    because the bite wounds tend to bleed profusely.
