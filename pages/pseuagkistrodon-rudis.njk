                    Medium-sized snake; total length up to 120 cm. There are 19-25 (23 at mid-body) rows of 
                    scales, which are heavily keeled. Head is broad, moderately triangular and 
                    moderately separated from neck; body is stout, slightly compressed or 
                    flattened; tail is moderately long. Eye is medium to large; iris is light 
                    brown with scattered areas of black, while anterior and posterior quarters 
                    of eye are dark brown, pupil is slightly oval to round, black, surrounded 
                    by irregular ring of light tan. Tongue is large, dark gray blue, fork tips 
                    light gray. Upper head is dark dirty brown to chocolate, with a prominent 
                    line of demarcation where the brown of the upper head meets the light 
                    brown, orange tinged side of head, extending from tip of nose along side 
                    of head to neck. Dorsal shields of head are large, but not distinct due to 
                    coloration and poorly developed sutures. The nuchal scales are heavily 
                    keeled. Upper body is brown to gray brown, may be tinted with bronze, 
                    interrupted by dark designs, variable in size, disposition and intensity 
                    of pigmentation. The irregular designs crossing the vertebral line in 
                    anterior half of body tend to lose continuity in the following part of 
                    body where they are replaced by roughly circular, separated designs along 
                    vertebral line. Other spots involving two to four scales occur on the 
                    sides of the body, and the posterior ones may fuse to form longitudinal 
                    lateral band. Ventral head is dirty white to dull orange gray. Ventral 
                    body is variable, dull dirty orange at neck with scattered dark gray to 
                    brown black pigment, overall color progressively darker posteriorly with 
                    mottled or marbled appearance in posterior parts of body. Anal scale is 
                    divided and subcaudals are paired.

                        This diurnal or nocturnal rear-fanged (= opistoglyphous, see footnote <i>(1)</i>) 
                        snake is found on mountainous forest floors, bush- and grassland, or near 
                        creeks. It feeds mainly on toads, but also on frogs, small snakes, 
                        lizards, insects and earthworms. Females give birth to 12-27 young per 
                        litter in late summer and fall; hatchlings measure 13-20 cm in total 
                        length. When irritated and excited, it may make every effort to act or 
                        appear as a venomous snake: the head and neck, or the entire body, may be 
                        flattened as the snake coils up in defense; when flattened, the oval 
                        head may take on a strong, definite triangular shape in an attempt to 
                        mimic vipers.

                        Many members of the family Colubridae that are considered venomous are essentially 
                        harmless to humans, because they either have small venom glands, 
                        relatively weak venom, or an inefficient system for venom delivery. This 
                        is also the case with M. r. rudis:

                    things point to a completely different direction. Some animals from the 
                    Macropisthodon genus have caused some severe bites and are now rated, 
                    by some scientists, as potentially lethal. The fangs are extremely long 
                    and grooved and look like the fangs of a boomslang (Dispholidus typus), 
                    a lethal rear-fanged snake from Africa. Macropisthodon have very mobile 
                    fangs as well. The ingredients of the the venom are not known, but the 
                    effects are bleeding and neurotoxic symptoms. It might be compared to the 
                    venom of Rhabdophis species. In my opinion, and other people as well, an extremely dangerous colubrid to get bitten by.
