                    Medium-sized snake; total length up to 128 cm. There are 21-33 (27-29 at mid-body) rows 
                    of scales, which are strongly keeled and rough (except for the outermost 
                    row). Head is triangular and distinct from neck; body is stout, slightly 
                    flattened; tail is short. Eye is medium-sized; iris is dark gray black, 
                    dappled with dirty yellow, pupil is vertically elliptical, black with 
                    conspicuous gray to yellow border. Nostril is very large, conspicuous, 
                    located in concavity on side of nose. The supraocular is well developed; 
                    there are no pits between eye and nostril. Tongue is dark gray to black, 
                    outer fork tips lighter. Fangs are large, hinged from upper jaw. Upper 
                    head is chocolate to dark brown black, with three large prominent designs 
                    on head; one between eyes, and the other two posteriorly. The scales on 
                    upper head are small and equal in size, heavily keeled and rough. The 
                    supralabials are white to cream mottled with dark pigment. Upper body and 
                    tail are brown to gray brown or chocolate, with white- to light 
                    brown-edged blotches or designs of variable size, shape and distribution. 
                    The areas around mid-dorsal series of blotches appear as a chain; the 
                    lateral series of designs contain smaller blotches tending to alternate 
                    with the mid-dorsal ones. Ventral head and neck are white to very light 
                    gray, speckled with diffuse black pigment; chin plates and gulars possess 
                    areas of black in posterior field of each scale, presenting an overall 
                    polka-dot appearance. Ventral body is progressively darker posteriorly due 
                    to flecks of dark gray or black pigment, with one to five semicircular 
                    designs on the ventrals. Underside of tail is darker than body. Anal scale 
                    is entire, and subcaudals are paired.

                        However, they will eat just about anything, including rats, mice, shrews, squirrels, land crabs, 
                        scorpions and other arthropods. Juveniles are crepuscular, feeding on lizards and foraging actively. 
                        As they grow and become adults, they begin to specialize in rodents. Indeed, the presence of rodents 
                        is the main reason they are attracted to human habitation. Juveniles are known to be cannibalistic.

                        may be found at any time. The gestation period is more than six months. Young are produced from May 
                        to November, but mostly in June and July. It is a prolific breeder. Litters of 20–40 are common, 
                        although there may be fewer offspring and as little as one. The reported maximum is 65 in a single 
                        litter. At birth, juveniles are 215–260 mm in length. The minimum length for a gravid female is about 
                        100 cm. It seems that sexual maturity is achieved in 2–3 years. In one case, it took a specimen nearly 
                        4.5 hours to produce 11 young.

                        it is one of a number of viperines that are apparently able to react to thermal cues, further 
                        supporting the notion that they too possess a heat-sensitive organ. The identity of this sensor 
                        is not certain, but the nerve endings in the supranasal sac of these snakes resemble those found 
                        in other heat-sensitive organs.

                        Adults are reported to be persistently slow and sluggish unless pushed beyond a certain limit, 
                        after which they becomes fierce and aggressive. Juveniles, on the other hand, are generally more 
                        active and will bite with minimal provocation. When threatened, the snake may form a series of 
                        S-loops, raise the first third of the body and produce a hiss through its large nostrils, that 
                        is supposedly louder than that of any other snake. When striking from this position, they can 
                        exert so much force that even a large individual can lift most of its body off the ground in 
                        the process. These are difficult snakes to handle: they are strong and agile and react violently 
                        to being picked up. The bite may be a mere snap, or they may hang on for many seconds.</i>

                        <i>D. russelli</i> produces a very powerful venom, and its bite is potentially fatal. In fact, 
                        the subspecies <i>D. r. russelli</i> on the Asian mainland is said to be responsible for more human 
                        fatalities than any other venomous snake. In Taiwan, due to the species' limited distribution, 
                        very few bites by <i>D. r. siamensis</i> have been reported, and antivenin is produced locally. 
                        Nevertheless, this species should be considered highly dangerous and treated with utmost caution.

                        <i>The amount of venom produced by individual specimens is considerable. Reported venom yields for 
                        adult specimens range from 130–250 mg to 150–250 mg to 21–268 mg. For 13 juveniles with an average 
                        length of 79 cm, the average venom yield was 8–79 mg (mean 45 mg).

                        0.08–0.31 μg/g intravenous, 0.40 μg/kg intraperitoneal, 4.75 mg/kg subcutaneous. For most humans 
                        a lethal dose is 40–70 mg. In general, the toxicity depends on a combination of five different 
                        venom fractions, each of which is less toxic when tested separately. Venom toxicity also varies 
                        within populations and over time.

                        Envenomation symptoms begin with pain at the site of the bite, immediately followed by 
                        swelling of the affected extremity. Bleeding is a common symptom, especially from the gums, 
                        and sputum may show signs of blood within 20 minutes post-bite. There is a drop in blood 
                        pressure and the heart rate falls. Blistering occurs at the site of the bite, developing 
                        along the affected limb in severe cases. Necrosis is usually superficial and limited to the 
                        muscles near the bite, but may be severe in extreme cases. Vomiting and facial swelling occurs 
                        in about one-third of all cases.

                    <div class="info-box-paragraph">
                        Severe pain may last for 2–4 weeks. Locally, it may persist depending on the level of tissue 
                        damage. Often, local swelling peaks within 48–72 hours, involving both the affected limb and 
                        the trunk. If swelling up to the trunk occurs within 1–2 hours, massive envenomation is likely. 
                        Discoloration may occur throughout the swollen area as red blood cells and plasma leak into 
                        muscle tissue. Death from septicaemia, respiratory or cardiac failure may occur 1 to 14 days 
                        post-bite or even later.

                    Because this venom is so effective at inducing thrombosis, it has been incorporated into an in vitro 
                    diagnostic test for blood clotting that is widely used in hospital laboratories. This test is often 
                    referred to as Dilute Russell's viper venom time (dRVVT). The coagulant in the venom directly activates 
                    factor X, which turns prothrombin into thrombin in the presence of factor V and phospholipid. The venom 
                    is diluted to give a clotting time of 23 to 27 seconds and the phospholipid is reduced to make the test 
                    extremely sensitive to phospholipid. The dRVVT test is more sensitive than the aPTT test for the detection 
                    of lupus anticoagulant (an autoimmune disorder), because it is not influenced by deficiencies in clotting 
                    factors VIII, IX or XI.</i>
