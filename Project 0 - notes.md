# CS50 Web Programming - Project 0


## To do

- Make a modern, mobile version of snakesofTaiwan.com (simplified version, only a few snakes)


## Steps

- [x] Make general index homepage layout with Grid, Flexbox and Bootstrap
- [x] make images responsive
- [x] crop images with CSS object-fit?
- [x] style
- [x] drop-down: adjust width of search input and lang input
- [x] make images responsive when hovered over (move a bit or incr. in size)
- [x] Make sure footer sticks to bottom using Grid or Flexbox (check my I & T Downloader project)
- [x] Make nav list items align when size is small and have font awesome images align
- [x] Nav items alignment is not ideal.... not aligned with content...left align? then right align search bar? Try make .navbar-items-container (flex container) span the viewport width and then make nav layout more evenly spaced...
- [x] Nav margins when screen size big...
- [x] menu icon color...change to white...
- [x] Add venomous icons - background - scull and crossbones, with some transparency??
- [x] active page - underline text?
- [x] Make snakes gallery filterable - https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_portfolio_filter.asp
- [x] Make mobile responsive...change grid-card size for mobile using an image query later.... (smaller....)
- [x] Make css neater, inherit properties... like in lecture add sass properties
- [x] Add filter: Taipei, common
- [ ] Nunjucks - templating language --> add to file, use because it is like Jinja2
- [ ] make some link pages for the snake species - example pages
- [ ] check that search works
- [ ] Check that I met requirements of CS50 project (I can add links in a table... write README...)
- [ ] After submitting, if it looks good... suggest a site update to Hans Breuer?
